Fairly stock XEmacs with the following changes:

	* added my X11 shift modifier patch
	* patches to allow it to build when XEmacs installed

Builds four packages (mimics the emacs packages):

	* xemacs - core with basic packages needed to run
	* xemacs-info - the info files (recommended)
	* xemacs-lisp - the source lisp files (optional)
	* xemacs-misc - various other files (very optional)

Since XEmacs is big, I do not provide the files. Go to the
http://xemacs.org/ site and download the following from a mirror:

        * xemacs-21.4.15.tar.bz2
	* packages/xemacs-base-1.86-pkg.tar.gz
	* packages/efs-1.32-pkg.tar.gz

The exact versions can be tweaked in the xemacs.SlackBuild file.
