XEmacs
------

Base binaries and support files for the XEmacs editor/environment.
This version requires X libraries installed but will run in a non-X
mode.

XEmacs is a highly customizable open source text editor and app-
lication development system. It is protected under the GNU Public
License and related to other versions of Emacs, in particular GNU
Emacs. Its emphasis is on modern graphical user interface support and
an open software development model, similar to Linux.


Requirements
------------

The xemacs.SlackBuild requires two XEmacs packages to build: efs and
xemacs-base. Here are links to the two packages:

http://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/efs-1.34-pkg.tar.gz
http://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/xemacs-base-2.19-pkg.tar.gz

Newer versions of these files are fine. Just update the BASE_VERSION
and EFS_VERSION defines in the xemacs.SlackBuild as required to match
the versions you downloaded.


Notes
-----

Fairly stock XEmacs with the following changes:

  * added my X11 shift modifier patch
  * patches to allow it to build when XEmacs is already installed

Since XEmacs is big, I do not provide the files. Go to the
http://xemacs.org/ site and download the following from a mirror:

  * xemacs-21.4.15.tar.bz2
  * packages/xemacs-base-1.86-pkg.tar.gz
  * packages/efs-1.32-pkg.tar.gz

The exact versions can be tweaked in the xemacs.SlackBuild file.
