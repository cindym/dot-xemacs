This is my attempt to live without gnus installed on my system. There
is nothing wrong with gnus, but it is huge and I don't use it. I tried
this once before years ago and gave up.... but it is going much better
this time.

parse-time.el needed by vc-cvs

time-date.el needed by erc (specifically erc-pcomplete)
