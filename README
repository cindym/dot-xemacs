This directory tree contains my config files and packages for XEmacs,
SXEmacs, and GNU Emacs.

A brief rundown:

* The config files are in the top level.

* The esp directory contains the "Emacs Special Packages". These are
  files needed only for GNU Emacs. They are in a non-standard place so
  that XEmacs will not automagically pick them up.

* The site-packages directory is laid out as per XEmacs. It should be
  automagically used. There is code in init.el to handle the GNU Emacs
  case.

* The slackbuild directory contains the files needed to build a
  Slackware package for XEmacs.

Running an old emacs?

If you are running an old emacs that does not support the .emacs.d
directory, create the following one line .emacs file:

(load "~/.emacs.d/init")
